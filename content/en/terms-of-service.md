# Terms of Service

*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

Welcome to **ai.hubtoday** (referred to as “**this Site**” or “**we**”). Before diving into our services, please take a moment to carefully read these Terms of Service. By accessing or using our Site, you’re basically saying, “Yep, I agree to these terms!”

## 1. What We Offer (Service Intro)
This Site offers users a whole bunch of awesome paid subscription content and member services! Think blog posts, exclusive resources, e-books, community interaction, and more. Just so you know, some of the really cool stuff is only for our subscribed members. 😉

## 2. User Registration & Accounts
- Users, you'll need to provide a valid email address and set a password to register for your account.
- Users are totally responsible for keeping their account secure and for all activities that happen under it. So, **no transferring or sharing** your account with anyone else – that's a big no-no! 🚫
- This Site has the right to **suspend or terminate** your account if you ever break these terms. Just sayin'!

## 3. Paid Subscription Services
- Subscription services are billed either monthly or annually, and you'll see all the costs clearly laid out on the checkout page.
- All payments go through awesome third-party payment platforms (think Stripe, PayPal 😉). Don't worry, this Site never stores your payment info directly.
- Subscriptions will **automatically renew**, so keep an eye on that! You'll need to cancel before your current billing cycle ends if you don't want to continue.
- **14-Day Refund Policy**: Here's the deal – if you're a first-time subscriber and not totally stoked with our service within 14 days of your purchase, you can totally ask for a full refund. Just shoot us an email (you'll find it at the end of these terms) and tell us why you're not happy. Heads up, though: this is a one-time thing per user. After 14 days, or if it's not your first rodeo, all payments are generally **non-refundable**, unless the law absolutely says otherwise.

## 4. Content Use & Intellectual Property
- All original content? Yep, that's **copyrighted by this Site (hubtoday)**. So, no copying, reposting, or using it for commercial stuff without our say-so. Seriously, don't do it. 🙅‍♀️
- Users only get a **non-exclusive, non-transferable access right** to our content, strictly for personal learning and reading. Keep it to yourself, alright?
- If you're thinking about commercial use or quoting a bunch, please hit us up to get authorization first. Thanks! 🙏

## 5. User Conduct Guidelines
- **Seriously forbidden**: Do not upload, post, or spread any content that's illegal, harassing, false, offensive, or infringes on anyone else's rights. Let's keep things chill and respectful!
- And also **forbidden**: Please don't try to bulk download, crawl, or crack our member content using any technical wizardry. That's just not cool. 🙅‍♂️
- This Site reserves the right to remove any inappropriate content and **ban users** who don't play by the rules. Consider yourself warned! 😉

## 6. Service Changes & Interruptions
- We totally reserve the right to change, suspend, or even terminate some or all of our services at any time, without giving you a heads-up. Just how it works!
- If, for some reason (like an act of God, server hiccups, or a third-party service going down), our content becomes temporarily unavailable, this Site **won't be liable for any compensation**. Bummer, we know, but it happens. 🤷‍♀️

## 7. Disclaimer
- The info this Site provides is purely for reference and **doesn't constitute** any kind of professional advice (like financial, legal, or medical stuff). So, don't take it as gospel!
- This Site **won't be responsible** for any direct or indirect losses you might experience from using our content or services. Just a heads-up!

## 8. Governing Law
- These Terms of Service are totally governed by and interpreted under the laws of the State of California, USA 🇺🇸, without getting into any messy conflict of law principles.
- For any disputes popping up from or related to these terms, both sides should first try to work it out nicely through friendly negotiation. If that doesn't pan out, you agree to let the competent courts in Santa Clara County, California, handle it. So, let's keep it friendly first! 😊
