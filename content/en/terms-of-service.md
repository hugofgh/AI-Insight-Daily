# Terms of Service

*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

**ai.hubtoday** (referred to as "**the Site**" or "**we**") welcomes you! 👋 Before diving into our services, please take a moment to carefully read these Terms of Service. By accessing or using the Site, you’re basically saying "I agree!" to these terms.

## 1. About Our Services
Our services offer users a sweet array of paid subscription content and member perks! 🎁 Think blog posts, exclusive resources, e-books, and even community interactions. Heads up: some goodies are only for our subscribed users.

## 2. User Registration & Accounts
- **Users** need to provide a valid email address and set a password to register for an account. Easy peasy!
- **Users** are totally responsible for their account's security and all activity happening under it. Seriously, **no transferring or sharing** your account with anyone else! 🚫
- **The Site** can actually suspend or terminate your account if you ever break these terms. Just a heads up!

## 3. Paid Subscription Services
- **Subscription services** are billed monthly/annually, with all costs clearly shown on the checkout page. No hidden fees, we promise!
- **All payments** go through secure third-party platforms (like Stripe, PayPal). Don't worry, we never store your payment info here! 💳
- **Subscriptions** will **auto-renew** unless you cancel before your current billing cycle ends. So keep an eye on that! 👀
- **Our 14-Day Refund Policy** is pretty cool: If you're a first-time subscriber and not totally stoked with our service, you can request a full refund within 14 days of purchase. Just hit us up at the contact email provided at the end of these terms and tell us why you're bouncing. Each user gets one shot at this refund. After 14 days, or if it's not your first time subscribing, all payments are **non-refundable** unless the law explicitly says otherwise. Fair is fair, right?

## 4. Content Usage & Intellectual Property
- **All original content** (that's the good stuff!) is **copyrighted by the Site (hubtoday)**. Seriously, don't copy, republish, or use it for commercial purposes without our express permission. That's a big no-no! 🙅‍♀️
- **Users** only get a **non-exclusive, non-transferable access right** to this content. It's just for your personal learning and reading pleasure, alright?
- If you're thinking about commercial use or want to quote us extensively, please just reach out to the Site for authorization. We're usually pretty friendly! 😉

## 5. User Conduct Guidelines
- **Please don't** upload, post, or spread any content that's illegal, harassing, false, offensive, or infringes on anyone else's rights. Let's keep things respectful! 🙏
- **It's a big no-no** to bulk download, scrape, or crack member-only content using any technical tricks. That's just not cool. 🚫
- **The Site** totally reserves the right to remove inappropriate content and **ban rule-breaking users**. So play nice!

## 6. Service Changes & Interruptions
- **We** totally reserve the right to change, suspend, or terminate any part or all of our services at any time, without prior notice. Just a heads up, things can evolve! 🚀
- If **content** becomes temporarily unavailable due to things like force majeure, server glitches, or third-party service interruptions, **the Site isn't liable for any compensation**. Bummer, we know, but sometimes stuff just happens!

## 7. Disclaimer
- **The info** provided on the Site is purely for reference. It **doesn't count** as any kind of professional advice (like financial, legal, medical, etc.). Always check with the pros!
- **The Site** is **not responsible** for any direct or indirect losses users might face from using our content or services. Just keeping it real here! 🤷‍♀️

## 8. Governing Law
- **These Terms of Service** are governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of California, USA, without regard to its conflict of law principles. So, California law is the boss! ⚖️
- If **any disputes** pop up from or relate to these terms, both parties agree to try and sort things out amicably first. If that doesn't work out, you agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in Santa Clara County, California. Let's hope it doesn't come to that, though! 😉
