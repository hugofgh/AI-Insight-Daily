# Terms of Service
*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

Hey there! 👋 Welcome to **ai.hubtoday** (which we'll refer to as "the Site" or "we" from now on). Before you dive into our awesome services, please take a moment to carefully read these Terms of Service. By accessing or using the Site, you're totally agreeing to everything here.

## 1. About Our Services
The Site provides users with a whole bunch of paid subscription content and membership services. This includes, but isn't limited to, blog posts, exclusive resources, e-books, and cool community interactions. Just a heads-up: some content is only accessible to our subscribed members. 😉

## 2. User Registration & Accounts
- Users gotta provide a valid email address and set up a password to register for an account. Easy peasy! ✨
- Listen up, users are totally responsible for their account's security and all the shenanigans that happen under it. **Absolutely no transferring or sharing your account, got it?** 🚫
- If users ever violate these terms, the Site has every right to **suspend or terminate** their account. Just sayin'.

## 3. Paid Subscription Services
- Subscription services are billed monthly or annually, with all fees clearly laid out on the checkout page. No hidden surprises! 💸
- All payments zip through secure third-party platforms (like Stripe or PayPal) – we never store your payment info ourselves. Your data is safe! 🔒
- Your subscription will **automatically renew**, unless you cancel it before your current billing cycle wraps up. Don't forget! 🗓️
- **Our Sweet 14-Day Refund Policy:** First-time subscribers, if you're not absolutely thrilled with the service within 14 days of purchase, you can totally snag a full refund. Just ping us at the contact email provided at the very end of these terms and tell us why you're bailing. Each user only gets one shot at this refund magic! ✨ Beyond the 14-day window or for non-first-time subscriptions, payments are generally **non-refundable**, unless the law explicitly says otherwise. So, choose wisely!

## 4. Content Usage & Intellectual Property
- Listen up: all original content is **copyrighted by the Site (hubtoday)**. That means you absolutely cannot copy, reproduce, or use it for commercial purposes without our express authorization, got it? We made it, it's ours! 😤
- Users are granted only a **non-exclusive, non-transferable right to access** our content, purely for personal learning and reading. Enjoy!
- If you're looking for commercial use or want to quote extensively, please reach out to the Site to snag some authorization. We're usually pretty chill about it! 😉

## 5. User Conduct Guidelines
- **Absolutely forbidden:** Uploading, posting, or spreading any content that's illegal, harassing, false, offensive, or infringes on anyone else's rights. Come on, play nice! 😠
- **Also a big no-no:** Using any tech wizardry to mass download, scrape, or crack our members-only content. Seriously, don't even try it. 🛑
- If any inappropriate content pops up, the Site totally has the right to remove it and **ban any rule-breaking users**. Consider yourself warned! 🔒

## 6. Service Changes & Interruptions
- We totally reserve the right to change, suspend, or even terminate parts or all of our services at any time, without giving you a prior heads-up. That's just how the cookie crumbles sometimes! 🤷‍♀️
- If content becomes temporarily unavailable due to force majeure, server meltdowns, or hiccups with third-party services, the Site **won't be liable for any compensation**. Bummer, we know. 😬

## 7. Disclaimer
- Heads up! The information provided on the Site is purely for reference. It **doesn't constitute** any professional advice – seriously, think financial, legal, medical, you name it! Always consult the real pros. 🧑‍⚕️⚖️💰
- For any direct or indirect losses users might experience from using the Site's content or services, the Site is **absolutely not responsible**. Just putting that out there! 😅

## 8. Governing Law
- Okay, legal stuff! These Terms of Service are totally governed by and interpreted according to the laws of California, USA, without messing with any conflict-of-law principles. Keeping it straightforward! 🇺🇸
- If any squabbles pop up from or related to these terms, both sides should totally try to work it out through friendly negotiation first. If that doesn't fly, you agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts in Santa Clara County, California. So, bring your legal A-game! 🏛️
