*Last updated: June 1, 2025*

---

This Privacy Policy is here to tell you all about how we collect, use, and spill the beans (or not!) on your info when you're using our Service. It's also gonna clue you in on your privacy rights and what the law's got your back on.

Your personal data? We're putting it to work to keep our Service awesome and always getting better. By hopping on board and using our Service, you're giving us the thumbs up to collect and use your info just as this Privacy Policy lays out. 👍

## Interpretations and Definitions

### Interpretation
Capitalized words? They've got special meanings, which you'll find defined below. And yep, these definitions hold true whether they're singular or plural – no funny business!

### Definitions
For the scoop on this Privacy Policy:

- **Account:** This is your very own unique account, set up so you can dive into our Service or parts of it.

- **Affiliate:** Think of this as a company that's either controlling, controlled by, or buddy-buddy with us under common control. "Control" here means owning half or more of the shares, equity, or voting power for directors and such.

- **Company:** (Aka "the Company," "We," "Us," or "Our" in this whole agreement) That's us, **hubtoday**!

- **Cookies:** These are tiny files websites pop onto your computer, phone, or any other gadget. They store tidbits like your browsing history on that site, among other cool stuff. 🍪

- **Country:** We're talking about: California, USA. 🇺🇸

- **Device:** Basically, any gadget that lets you get to the Service, like your computer, phone, or tablet.

- **Personal Data:** This is any info that's all about you, an identified or identifiable individual.

- **Service:** That's our Website, right here!

- **Service Provider:** This is anyone – a person or a company – who crunches data for us. Think of them as the awesome third-party folks we hire to help run the Service, provide it, or even just help us figure out how people are using it.

- **Usage Data:** This is the info we automatically gather, either from you using the Service or from the Service's tech infrastructure itself (like how long you've been chilling on a page).

- **Website:** This is **hubtoday**, which you can find right here: `https://ai.hubtoday.app/`.

- **You:** That's you! The person checking out or using our Service. Or, if you're doing this for a company or other legal entity, then "You" means that entity.

## Collecting and Using Your Personal Data

### Types of Data Collected

#### Personal Data
When you're using our Service, we might ask for some personal info that helps us get in touch or figure out who you are. This "personally identifiable information" might include, but isn't limited to:

- Email address
- Usage Data

#### Usage Data
Usage Data? It's automatically gathered whenever you're using the Service.

Usage Data may include information such as your Device's Internet Protocol address (e.g. IP address), browser type, browser version, the pages of our Service that you visit, the time and date of your visit, the time spent on those pages, unique device identifiers, and other diagnostic data.

If you're hitting up the Service on your mobile, we might automatically grab some info. This could include your phone's type, its unique ID, IP address, operating system, the mobile browser you're using, unique device identifiers, and other diagnostic goodies. 📱

Oh, and your browser? It sends us info too, whenever you visit our Service, whether you're on a computer or your phone.

### Tracking Technologies and Cookies
We're all about using Cookies and other tracking tech to keep tabs on what's happening on our Service and to save a bit of info. These cool tracking tools—like beacons, tags, and scripts—help us gather and follow data, all to make our Service better and figure out how it's rocking. Some of the tech we use might be:

- **Cookies (or Browser Cookies, if you're fancy)**: Picture a Cookie as a tiny file that lands on your device. You can totally tell your browser to kick all Cookies to the curb or to give you a heads-up when one's coming your way. Just a heads-up though, if you say no to Cookies, some parts of our Service might not play nice. Unless you've tweaked your browser settings to block 'em, our Service will likely be using Cookies.
- **Web Beacons**: Some parts of our Service and even our emails might have these tiny electronic files called web beacons (or clear gifs, pixel tags, single-pixel gifs – lots of names!). They're super handy for us to count folks who've visited a page or opened an email, and for other cool website stats, like how popular a section is or to double-check our systems are running smoothly.

Now, Cookies can be either "Persistent" or "Session" Cookies. Persistent ones hang around on your computer or phone even after you're offline. Session Cookies? Poof! They're gone as soon as you close your browser.

We use both Session and Persistent Cookies for a few specific reasons, which we'll spill below:

- **Necessary / Essential Cookies**
  - **Type**: Session Cookies
  - **Administered by**: Us
  - **Purpose**: Okay, these Cookies are the absolute backbone for making our Website services available to you and letting you actually *use* its cool features. They're key to verifying who you are and keeping those pesky fraudsters away from your account. Seriously, without these, you wouldn't get the services you asked for, and we *only* use them to deliver those services to you.

- **Cookies Policy / Notice Acceptance Cookies**
  - **Type**: Persistent Cookies
  - **Administered by**: Us
  - **Purpose**: These smart Cookies just remember if you've already given us the nod to use Cookies on the Website.

- **Functionality Cookies**
  - **Type**: Persistent Cookies
  - **Administered by**: Us
  - **Purpose**: These handy Cookies let us remember all the choices you've made while using the Website – like your login info or what language you prefer. The whole point? To give you a super personalized experience so you don't have to type in your preferences every single time you visit!

Want more deets on the Cookies we use and your options? Just swing by our Cookies Policy or the Cookies section in this very Privacy Policy.

### Use of Your Personal Data
So, what does the Company do with Personal Data? We might use it for these purposes:

- **To keep our Service running smoothly and looking good**, and that includes keeping an eye on how folks are using it.
- **To manage Your Account**: This means handling your registration as a Service user. The Personal Data you share lets you tap into all the cool features available only to registered users.
- **To get those contracts done**: This covers setting up, following, and fulfilling the purchase contracts for whatever products, items, or services you've bought, or any other agreement you've made with us through the Service.
- **To get in touch with you**: We might ping you via email, phone call, SMS, or other digital ways (like push notifications from our app!) to tell you about updates or important info related to features, products, or services you've signed up for – including security updates – whenever it's necessary or makes sense. 🔔
- **To dish out the news**: We'll send you updates, sweet deals, and general info about other cool stuff, services, and events we've got going on – especially if they're similar to things you've already bought or shown interest in. Of course, you can always opt-out if you're not into it!
- **To handle your requests**: We'll take care of and manage any requests you send our way.
- **For business shake-ups**: If we ever merge, get sold off, restructure, or deal with any other kind of asset transfer (like in a bankruptcy), we might use your info to assess or go through with it. Your Personal Data as a Service user would be one of those assets getting transferred.
- **For other cool stuff**: We might also use your info for other reasons, like digging into data, spotting usage trends, figuring out if our promos are actually working, and generally making our Service, products, marketing, and your whole experience even better. ✨

We might share your personal info when these situations pop up:

- **With Service Providers**: We might hand over your personal info to Service Providers. Why? So they can help us keep an eye on Service usage and get in touch with you.
- **For business shake-ups**: We might share or transfer your personal info if we're in the middle of (or negotiating!) a merger, selling off company assets, financing, or another company is acquiring all or part of our business.
- **With Affiliates**: We might share your info with our affiliates. Don't worry, we'll make sure they play by the rules of this Privacy Policy too! Affiliates are basically our parent company, subsidiaries, joint venture pals, or any other companies we control or share control with.
- **With business partners**: We might team up with our business partners and share your info to bring you certain products, services, or cool promotions.
- **With other users**: If you're sharing personal info or chatting it up in public areas with other users, just know that info could be seen by everyone and potentially blasted out there publicly. So, think before you share! 🗣️
- **With your 'okay'**: For anything else, if you give us the green light, we might share your personal info.

### Retention of Your Personal Data
The Company will only hang onto your Personal Data for as long as we absolutely need it for the purposes we've laid out in this Privacy Policy. We'll also keep and use your data as much as needed to stick to our legal duties (like if the law says we have to), sort out any disagreements, and enforce our agreements and policies.

The Company also keeps Usage Data for our own internal analysis. Generally, Usage Data sticks around for a shorter time, *unless* we're using it to pump up the security or boost the features of our Service, or if the law tells us we have to hold onto it for longer.

### Transfer of Your Personal Data
Your information, including Personal Data, gets processed right here at the Company's offices and wherever else our processing partners are chilling. This means your data might zip across borders and land on computers outside your state, province, or country. Just a heads-up, the data protection laws there might be different from where you are.

By agreeing to this Privacy Policy and sending us your info, you're basically saying "yep!" to that data transfer.

The Company is gonna pull out all the stops to make sure your data is handled securely and follows this Privacy Policy. We won't ship your Personal Data off to any organization or country unless we're darn sure there are solid controls in place, especially when it comes to the security of your data and other personal info.

### Deleting Your Personal Data
You've got the power to delete or ask us to help you delete any Personal Data we've gathered about you. Poof! 🪄

Our Service might even let you zap some of your info right from inside the Service itself. How convenient!

Wanna update, change, or delete your info? Easy! Just log into your Account (if you have one, of course) and hit up the account settings where you can manage your personal deets. Or, you can just give us a shout and ask to access, correct, or delete any personal info you've given us.

Just a heads-up though, we might need to hang onto some info if the law says so or if we have a solid legal reason to keep it.

### Disclosure of Your Personal Data

#### Business Transactions
If the Company ever gets caught up in a merger, acquisition, or selling off assets, your Personal Data might get transferred. But don't sweat it, we'll give you a heads-up before your data moves and falls under a new Privacy Policy.

#### Law enforcement
Sometimes, the Company might have to spill your Personal Data if the law demands it, or if public authorities (like a court or government agency) send us a valid request. 👮

#### Other legal requirements
The Company might share your Personal Data if we genuinely believe it's necessary to:
- Comply with a legal obligation
- Protect and defend the rights or property of the Company
- Prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing in connection with the Service
- Protect the personal safety of Users of the Service or the public
- Protect against legal liability

### Security of Your Personal Data
The security of your Personal Data is super important to us! But let's be real, nothing transmitted over the internet or stored electronically is ever 100% bulletproof. While we bust our butts to use the best commercially acceptable ways to protect your Personal Data, we just can't promise it's *absolutely* safe. 🛡️➡️🔓

## Children's Privacy
Our Service isn't for anyone under 13. Period. We definitely don't intentionally collect personal info from kids under 13. If you're a parent or guardian and you find out your child has slipped us some Personal Data, please, please get in touch! If we discover we've accidentally grabbed a kid's Personal Data without parental consent, we'll quickly wipe that info from our servers. 🧒🚫

If we need your "okay" to process your info (and your country says parents need to give that "okay"), then we might ask for your parent's consent before we collect and use that info.

## Links to Other Websites
Our Service might have links to other websites that aren't run by us. If you click on one of those third-party links, you'll be whisked away to their site. We seriously recommend you check out the Privacy Policy of *every* site you visit. Better safe than sorry!

We've got zero control over, and take zero responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services. Just keeping it real. 🤷‍♀️

## Changes to this Privacy Policy
We might tweak our Privacy Policy now and then. When we do, we'll let you know about any changes by simply posting the fresh new Privacy Policy right here on this page.

Before any changes kick in, we'll give you a heads-up via email and/or a noticeable announcement on our Service. We'll also update that "Last updated" date right at the top of this Privacy Policy.

We totally recommend you peek at this Privacy Policy every now and then for any updates. Changes to this Privacy Policy are official the moment they're posted right here.
